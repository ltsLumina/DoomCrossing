/// Simple class to initialize the game.
/// Instantiates the 'Systems' prefab that includes every manager in your game.
/// You must create a folder by name 'Resources' (CaSe SeNsItIvE) and place/create the 'Systems' prefab inside it.
/// Alternatively, you can use the Resources folder and Systems prefab provided in this package.
/// HOWEVER, if you are not using the provided Systems prefab, you should DELETE the 'Systems' folder from the package.
