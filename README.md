# DoomCrossing
 The life was quiet all around A cute little island Nice and non-violent But everything turned upside down When a new guy came to town We got along, he showed me ways To craft and test things That cut intestines Said we could party at his place All the holidays It's just what I need To watch demons bleed Their blood on my paws Unholy hordes slaughtered Now I feel complete Our worlds collide on eternal horizons A wild ride, every turn is surprising We rip and tear until it's done Then head back home and have some fun Together we are One! One! One! One! Together we are One! One! One! One! Reports and papers, nine to five I kept things in order Dying of boredom Always enraged, he spent his life Giving imps PTSD Unlikely friends, two troubled minds Like sister and brother We learn from each other A simple work-life balance guide That made us a perfect team In the first age, on the first vacation Eternal rage he unleashed upon a fruit plantation In smashing rocks with passion and carnation cultivation His scorched soul finally found a long-sought salvation The light of friendship shines through two dimensions Two puzzle pieces, each other's extensions Fishing rods, big freaking guns Hell yeah, together we are one Our worlds collide on eternal horizons A wild ride, every turn is surprising We rip and tear until it's done Then head back home and have some fun Together we are One! One! One! One! Together we are One! One! One! One! We are one
